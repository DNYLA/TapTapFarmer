TapTapHeroes Bot which automates alot of fighting and looting in the game. The Program does not 100% automate the game as it was never finished (that wasn't the end goal anyways).

If you would like to use this you first need to remove the call to the login form and you may also need to update some of the colour constants.

If you are looking at making your own C# Tap Tap heroes bot or any android bot i would suggest looking at this repo https://github.com/DanyaalA/Stick-Hero-Android-Bot
and incoporate the ADB input from that project with the code in here. Using ADB to create an android bot is alot easier as it allows yout to take screenshots and input keys or emulate mouse right/left click and swipe without using your actual mouse.
